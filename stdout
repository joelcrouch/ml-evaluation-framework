Thank you so much for providing that output! This is exactly what I needed.

The error message `sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable) relation "model_runs" does not exist` clearly indicates that the database tables have not been created in your PostgreSQL database.

This is a straightforward fix. Here's what we need to do:

1.  **Please stop the FastAPI server** that is currently running in your terminal by pressing `CTRL+C`.
2.  Once the server is stopped, I will instruct you to **run the `scripts/setup_db.py` script**. This script is designed to create all the necessary tables (like `model_runs`, `test_cases`, etc.) in your database.
3.  After the tables are created, I will ask you to **restart the FastAPI server in the foreground again**.
4.  Finally, you can **re-run `scripts/seed_cv_test_cases.py`** in a separate terminal, and it should now work without the `500 Internal Server Error`.

Please let me know once you have stopped the FastAPI server, and I will provide the command to set up the database.
